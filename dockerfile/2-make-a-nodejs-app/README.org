* Build a Node.js App
*** Dockerfile instructions
**** FROM
~FROM node:12-stretch~

**** USER
~USER node~
USER instruction let's us switch from being the root user to a different user, one called "node"

**** WORKDIR
~WORKDIR /home/node/code~
WORKDIR works as if you had cd'd into that directory, so now all paths are relative to that. And again, if it doesn't exist, it will create it for you.

**** COPY
~COPY index.js index.js~
First thing is we have to copy this file from your local file system into the container.

~COPY index.js /home/node/code/index.js~

**** CMD
~CMD ["node", "index.js"]~

~CMD ["node", "/home/node/code/index.js"]~

*** Instructions on running
**** build and run
#+begin_src 
docker build -t my-node-app .
docker run --init --publish 3000:3000 my-node-app
#+end_src

we could also use ~--p~ for publish
