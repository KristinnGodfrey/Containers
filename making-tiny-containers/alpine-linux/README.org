* Alpine Containers

*** Alpine
Alpine linux is a distro of linux that is very bare-bones, we got the core, but would need to add any other bin files. Migrating from node-lates to alpine We go from about 900mb to 5mb

*** Debian stretch slim
A possibility to use about 150mb is to use f.x. ~node:12-stretch-slim~ with full debian

*** Security in small projects
Before we send our product out to production, it would be good to get it running in alpine, cause smaller file size means its more maintainable and secure.

** Dockerfile instructions
#+begin_src 
FROM node:12-alpine

USER node

RUN mkdir /home/node/code

WORKDIR /home/node/code

COPY --chown=node:node package-lock.json package.json ./

RUN npm ci

COPY --chown=node:node . .

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
#+end_src

To see size we run: ~node inspect my-node-app | jq~
